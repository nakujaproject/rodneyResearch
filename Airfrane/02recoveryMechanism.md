# Recovery mechanism

This is the actual deployment of the recovery mechanism in slowing down the rocket. This also includes opening latches to push out parachutes.

Some examples of the recovery mechanisms are:

1. Parachutes. This is the most effective method of recovery system.
2. Side deployment. The parachute is ejected on the outside of the rocket using some kind of spring mechanism
3. Inline deployment. The parachute is ejected along the axis of the rocket.
4. Streamer. It is deployment same as the parachute.
5. Wings, glider. This is commonly ised as passive control.
6. Changing CG, This involves changing the weight of the rocket in order to shift stability.
7. Changing CP, centre of pressure in order to move air surfaces to change the flight's stability.
8. Balloon. A balloon can be inflated from an internally stored pressure chamber in order to increase the rocket's drag.

For N1 rocket we choose the parachute system. This is to slow the rocket to an acceptable descent rate to ensure survival of the avionics. There is usually a backup system e.g deploying to parachutes or using two different methods.

A parachutre is basically a flexible device whose function is to produce drag. It 

Dual deploy means there is a primary and secondary parachute to reduce the impact. The first is generally stronger to overcome large velocities and stabilize the rocket. The second one is attached to teh first one via a tow-line and is used to reduce drift away from launch site.

The shock cord, rubber band, is used to as a gravity coupler. This is to store kinetic energy before opening up the parachute.
